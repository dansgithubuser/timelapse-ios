Free timelapse apps suffer from hubris. They assume that nothing will go wrong during the creation of a timelapse. You are expected to start capture, complete it, and render to video in one shot without anything going wrong. Garbage.

Rather, let's save an image at a time, so that if something breaks, we still have all the images captured so far.

This is the minimal amount of effort required to get iOS to do such a thing. I wanted to do a web solution to avoid having to avoid the app store, but seems like capturing a still image, as opposed to a frame of a video, is not something web does right now.
